I grew up in a bohemian style, even though at the time I didn't even know what that word meant.  Among my friends, I was one of the first to enjoy the delights of this life, no matter how harmful they were to my body and health, I have stories that will last until the end of my life and when that day comes, I have already told all my close companions that I want to see everyone in floral shirts and shorts, with lots of drinks, food, music and fun.
 When I was younger, I thought I would like people to take me seriously, a mere mistake, a mistake from a young man who once wore a burgundy all-star and tied his hair, without knowing he was hiding from himself.
 They tell me and they told me that I'm a bum, because my foot has a slipper mark, because sometimes I drink and smoke, also because I have many friends whose names I don't remember;  for such people, know that I want much more even though I am a bohemian, as such I made a lot of mistakes, however, I was loyal until the last day even with those who I didn't know if I wanted the name.  I've been told that my stubbly beard will one day overshadow my lazy hair, which I cultivated during the years I tried to be taken seriously.
 I no longer think about the exactness of things, mathematics for me has become an approximation, I see everything changeable and in this even those who are uncertain may one day have a certain shred of reason, in the midst of the confusion of the world I am still a nihilist who in this goes and Sometimes I'm a hedonist, like every good bohemian I keep doing the simple and effective thing even with unorthodox methods;  simplistic and unconcerned with the exactitude that governs things, approximation is the true path to balance, between right and wrong I will never be exact!
 Today, in a farewell tone, I can say that Pierre was right, I became a bohemian, living carefree, relaxed and cured of social ills, with a flowered shirt, my slippers and my happy mood even on the saddest days.  May Frigo be enjoying his vermouth, may Larissa still remember me, may they not forget my favorite drink and may everyone say goodbye with a Friday nightcap.
 Accept your bohemian side, stop worrying a little and enjoy the subtle pleasures that life gives you!
